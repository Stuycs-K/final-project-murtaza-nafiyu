## Overview

The classic game of PAC-MAN, recreated in Processing. Eat the pac-dots and eat the ghosts using power-pellets to gain score, and aim for the highest score you can. Don't get eaten by the ghosts!
Not being SUPER PAC-MAN (eating a power pellet) and touching a ghost will cause you to die, and go back to the beginning. Collecting all the pac-dots will allow you to win. Being SUPER-PACMAN will allow you to eat ghosts and send them to their starting position.

## Instructions (Directions)

[W, A, S, D] - Move PAC-MAN in the 4 cardinal directions.

Eat all the pellets to win.

Eat POWER-PELLETS in order to be able to eat ghosts for a short while.

Don't get touched by GHOSTs without eating a POWER-PELLET, or you will be sent back to the start.

Cheats:

[Z] - PAC-MAN automatically eats a POWER-PELLET (You are able to eat ghosts for a short while.)

[X] - Freeze ghosts. (To make it easier to play.)

[C] - Automatically win the game. (Currently, there is no win screen. So this just freezes your game.

## Bugs

There is only two bugs, which are with wall collisions and POWER-PELLETs. The collisions are pretty ungenerous, so you may get stuck sometimes. Just press the other direction keys and you should be out of any jams.
Additionally, sometimes POWER-PELLETs don't work. Use the cheat code associated (Z) in order to test POWER-PELLETs.
