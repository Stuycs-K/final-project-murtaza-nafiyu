## Overview

The classic game of PAC-MAN, recreated in Processing. Eat the pac-dots and eat the ghosts using power-pellets to gain score, and aim for the highest score you can. Don't get eaten by the ghosts!

## Instructions

[W, A, S, D] - Move PAC-MAN in the 4 cardinal directions.
Eat pellets to increase score. A scoreboard system is not implemented yet.
Eat POWER-PELLETS in order to be able to eat ghosts for a short while.
Don't get touched by GHOSTs, or you will be sent back to the start and lose a life. (Lives are not implemented yet, either)

Cheats:
[Z] - PAC-MAN automatically eats a POWER-PELLET (You are able to eat ghosts for a short while.)

[X] - Freeze ghosts. (To make it easier to play.)

[C] - Automatically win the game. (Currently, there is no win screen. So this just freezes your game.
